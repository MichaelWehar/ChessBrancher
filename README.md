# To-Do List
Suggestions:

1. After every position if you can provide the move played, and the move number.

2. Highlighting the move played (from and to square) also would be nice.

3. Listing which color has the next move.

More Suggestions:

4. Option for collapsing a branch.

5. Remove a branch.

6. Note taking (comments for position).

7. Tick Mark, to indicate, the move is already analyzed. 

8. Get a list of moves (from the start FEN) or the latest FEN for  any position.

Thank you very much to Tamal for providing many of these great suggestions!
