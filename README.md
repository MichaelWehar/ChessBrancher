# To-Do List
Suggestions:

1. After every position if you can provide the move played and the move number.

2. Highlighting the move played (from and to square) also would be nice.

3. Listing which color has the next move.

4. Option for collapsing a branch.

5. Remove a branch.

6. Note taking (comments for position).

7. Tick Mark, to indicate, the move is already analyzed. 

8. Get a list of moves (from the start FEN) or the latest FEN for  any position.

9. Have an option for the tree to expand to the right instead of downward.

10. Allow the special move en passant.  Also, fix castling so that it follows the rules of chess.

Thank you very much to Tamal and themusicdan for providing great suggestions!
